# Teams app CI/CD transparent guide
This document provide guidance on how to setup CI/CD pipeline for teams app created with the Teams Toolkit using your custom approach.

## how to write deploy section in your customized way
The most convenient way to deploy teams app is using teamsapp cli's "teamspp deploy" command. If you cannot use teamsapp cli in your pipepline, you can follow the following guide.

The "teamsapp deploy" command executes the actions in teamsapp.yml's "deploy" section and this section contains 2 parts: build and deploy. What you need to do is rewritting these actions into your own way.

Taking basic bot typescript project as an example, it's teamsapp.yml is as following:
```yml
deploy:
  # Run npm command
  - uses: cli/runNpmCommand
    name: install dependencies
    with:
      args: install
  - uses: cli/runNpmCommand
    name: build app
    with:
      args: run build --if-present
  # Deploy your application to Azure App Service using the zip deploy feature.
  # For additional details, refer to https://aka.ms/zip-deploy-to-app-services.
  - uses: azureAppService/zipDeploy
    with:
      # Deploy base folder
      artifactFolder: .
      # Ignore file location, leave blank will ignore nothing
      ignoreFile: .webappignore
      # The resource id of the cloud resource to be deployed to.
      # This key will be generated by arm/deploy action automatically.
      # You can replace it with your existing Azure Resource id
      # or add it to your environment variable file.
      resourceId: ${{BOT_AZURE_APP_SERVICE_RESOURCE_ID}}
```
These actions will first run `npm build` to build the project, then deploy the code to app service.

You can rewrite these actions as following in your CI/CD pipeline:
```yml
    # build
    - name: Setup Node 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'
    - name: 'npm install, build'
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present

    - name: 'zip artifact for deployment'
      run: |
        zip -r deploy.zip . --include 'node_modules/*' 'lib/*' 'web.config'

    # deploy
    - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        client-id: ${{ vars.CLIENT_ID }}
        tenant-id: ${{ vars.TENANT_ID }}
        subscription-id: ${{ vars.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

    - name: 'Run Azure webapp deploy action using azure RBAC'
      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
      with:
        app-name: ${{ vars.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
        package: deploy.zip
```
