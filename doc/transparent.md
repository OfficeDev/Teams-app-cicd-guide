# Teams app CI/CD transparent guide
This document provide guidance on how to setup CI/CD pipeline for teams app created with the Teams Toolkit using your custom approach.

## Custom Deployment Approach
The most convenient way to deploy teams app to Azure is using [teamsapp CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/teams-toolkit-cli?pivots=version-three)'s `teamspp deploy` command. If you're unable to leverage the teamsapp CLI within your pipeline, you can create a custom deployment process tailored to your needs.

The `teamsapp deploy` command executes the actions in teamsapp.yml's "deploy" stage. Most of the "deploy" stages consists of "build" and "deploy" actions. What you need to do is rewritting these actions into your own way.

Taking basic bot typescript project as an example, its teamsapp.yml's deploy stage is as following:
```yml
deploy:
  # Run npm command
  - uses: cli/runNpmCommand
    name: install dependencies
    with:
      args: install
  - uses: cli/runNpmCommand
    name: build app
    with:
      args: run build --if-present
  # Deploy your application to Azure App Service using the zip deploy feature.
  # For additional details, refer to https://aka.ms/zip-deploy-to-app-services.
  - uses: azureAppService/zipDeploy
    with:
      # Deploy base folder
      artifactFolder: .
      # Ignore file location, leave blank will ignore nothing
      ignoreFile: .webappignore
      # The resource id of the cloud resource to be deployed to.
      # This key will be generated by arm/deploy action automatically.
      # You can replace it with your existing Azure Resource id
      # or add it to your environment variable file.
      resourceId: ${{BOT_AZURE_APP_SERVICE_RESOURCE_ID}}
```
These actions do the following things:
- run `npm install` and `npm build` to build the project.
- deploy code to Azure app service.

You can rewrite these actions in your CI/CD pipeline in your own way. 
Below is an example of using GitHub official actions:
```yml
    # build
    - name: Setup Node 18.x
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '18.x'
    - name: 'npm install, build'
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present

    - name: 'zip artifact for deployment'
      run: |
        zip -r deploy.zip . --include 'node_modules/*' 'lib/*' 'web.config'

    # deploy
    - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
      uses: azure/login@v1
      with:
        client-id: ${{ vars.CLIENT_ID }}
        tenant-id: ${{ vars.TENANT_ID }}
        subscription-id: ${{ vars.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}

    - name: 'Run Azure webapp deploy action using azure RBAC'
      uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
      with:
        app-name: ${{ vars.AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME }}
        package: deploy.zip
```

Currently, the Teams Toolkit supports Teams app projects written in different programming languages and suitable to be hosted on different Azure services. Below lists some official actions for build and deploy. You can refer to these actions when setting up CI/CD deployment pipelines.

Build:

| language      | GitHub                    |Azure Pipeline
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----|
| JS/TS                | [actions/setup-node](https://github.com/actions/setup-node)  |[NodeTool@0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/node-tool-v0?view=azure-pipelines) | 
| C#      | [actions/setup-dotnet](https://github.com/actions/setup-dotnet)  |[DotNetCoreCLI@2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/dotnet-core-cli-v2?view=azure-pipelines)|


Deploy:

| resource   | GitHub                  |Azure Pipeline
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----|
| Azure App Service               |[azure/webapps-deploy](https://github.com/Azure/webapps-deploy)| [AzureWebApp@1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-web-app-v1?view=azure-pipelines)
| Azure Functions     |[Azure/functions-action](https://github.com/Azure/functions-action)|[AzureFunctionApp@2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-function-app-v2?view=azure-pipelines)
|Azure Static Web Apps             |[Azure/static-web-apps-deploy](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-deploy)| [AzureStaticWebApp@0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/azure-static-web-app-v0?view=azure-pipelines)|

### Credential needed for login to Azure
If you are using CI/CD to deploy app code to Azure app service, Azure functions or Azure container app, you need a service principal to login to Azure. There are 2 ways of login to Azure using service principal: using **OpenID Connect(OIDC)** or **secret**.

- OIDC (recommended)

  OIDC is the recommended way since it has increased security. To use it in GitHub actions, follow this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#create-a-microsoft-entra-application-and-service-principal) to create the service principal and add federated credentials, and set the client id , tenant id and sub id in GitHub repo variables, then you can use Azure/login action like following:
  ```yml
  - name: 'Login using OIDC'
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          client-id: ${{ vars.SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID }}
          tenant-id: ${{ vars.SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_TENANT_ID }}
          subscription-id: ${{ vars.SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
  ```
  > To use OIDC in GitHub actions, you need to modify the permission in CI/CD:
  ```yml
  permissions: 
    id-token: write
    contents: read
  ```

  For Azure pipeline, ypu need to create a [workload identity federation service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-using-workload-identity-federation). Then you can use the connection name in your pipeline:

  ```yml
  - task: AzureWebApp@1
    inputs:
      azureSubscription: $(connection_name)
      appName: $(app_name)
      package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/'
    displayName: 'Deploy to Azure Web App'
  ```

- Secret

  For Github actions, follow this [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-portal%2Cwindows#use-the-azure-login-action-with-a-service-principal-secret) to create a service principal and secret. Then you can use Azure/login action like:
  ```yml
      - uses: Azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: '{"clientId":"${{ secrets.CLIENT_ID }}","clientSecret":"${{ secrets.CLIENT_SECRET }}","subscriptionId":"${{ secrets.SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}","tenantId":"${{ secrets.TENANT_ID }}"}'
  ```
  For Azure pipeline, you need to create a [service principal service connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-using-a-service-principal-secret). Then you can use the service connection name in actions like below:
  ```yml
      - task: AzureWebApp@1
        inputs:
          azureSubscription: $(connection_name)
          appName: $(app_name)
          package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/'
        displayName: 'Deploy to Azure Web App'
  ```
## Prepare the appPackage for the teams app
You will need the `appPackage` to distribute your Teams app. Teamsapp CLI's command "teamsapp package" can help you create the `appPackage.zip` automatically. If you cannot leverage teamsapp CLI to do this, you can follow below steps to create the appPackage by hand.
1. prepare a `appPackage/` folder.

1. put `mainfest.json` in `appPackage` folder.

    The default `manifest.json` in Teams Toolkit project has placeholders (wrapped in ${{}}). You should replace these placeholders with true values.

2. put app icons in `appPackage` folder.
    
    Follow the guide to prepare [app icons](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-package#app-icons). You should have 2 .png files as output.
3. zip the appPackage folder.
    Zip the `appPackage/` folder into `appPackage.zip`.
